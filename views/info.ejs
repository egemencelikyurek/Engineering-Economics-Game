                    <p style="text-align: justify;">GamEco that simulates economic decision-making taking place in a
                        company has been developed for a course on engineering economics as a semester long-project.
                        GamEcoâ€™s object is not just to help students to learn engineering economics principles, but also
                        helps to use these principles in a competitive environment to make practical economic decisions.
                        In this simulation game, every student starts with an equal amount of money, and presented with
                        a list of investment opportunities. Students use the principles that learned during lessons to
                        decide on possible investments. Further investment opportunities are designed to be provided
                        every week over the semester, and the necessary analysis will become ever more complex as the
                        knowledge base of students increases.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The practical aim of engineering economics is to allow the engineer
                        to take reasonable investments. The game fulfills the functions of typical homework problems,
                        but it has other goals, and benefits like establishing a framework for active material learning.
                        Students must not only study different techniques of economic analysis, but also have to decide
                        which are most suitable for that particular situation. It also creates a friendly, comfortable
                        and casual classroom atmosphere that is also educational.
